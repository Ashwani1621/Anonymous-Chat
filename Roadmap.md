**1. Define Core Features**<br>
Anonymous Sign-Up/Login: No personal information (name, email) should be required.
Chat Rooms: Allow users to join predefined or dynamic chat rooms (e.g., by topic, event, or random).
Direct Messages (Optional): Allow one-on-one anonymous conversations.
Message History: Store messages temporarily, but ensure privacy and implement message deletion after a certain period.
Moderation: Implement basic moderation to prevent inappropriate content.
User Reporting: Allow users to report abusive behavior.

**2. Tech Stack Selection**<br>
Frontend (User Interface):

HTML/CSS: Basic structure and styling.
JavaScript/React: Dynamic user interactions.
WebSocket Integration: Real-time messaging for chats (e.g., with Socket.IO).

Backend (Server and Database):

Node.js with Express: For handling server logic and chat APIs.
Socket.IO: For real-time messaging support.
NoSQL Database (MongoDB): To store messages, rooms, and minimal anonymous user data (randomly generated user IDs).
Authentication: Use tokens (e.g., JWTs) without storing user details.

Hosting:

Heroku or Vercel: For deploying the app.
MongoDB Atlas: For cloud-hosted databases.

**3. Design User Interface (UI)**<br>
Chat Room List: Display active rooms, allow users to join or create new ones.
Message Interface: Simple chat interface with:
Message input box
Sent/received messages
User avatars (randomly generated for anonymity)
Anonymity Controls: Allow users to change display names randomly or shuffle.

**4. Backend Functionality**<br>
User Anonymity:
Assign random user IDs when a user connects.
Allow temporary nicknames (e.g., "User1234").
Real-Time Messaging:
Use Socket.IO for real-time message broadcasting to all users in a chat room.
Ensure messages appear instantly for all users in the same room.
Moderation:
Implement a system to filter inappropriate words using a library like bad-words.
Allow messages to be flagged for review.
Consider adding basic rate-limiting to prevent spam.

**5. Database Setup**<br>
Message Storage:
Store messages temporarily with a timestamp.
Set up a cron job to delete messages after a certain time (e.g., 24 hours).
Chat Rooms:
Store room names, IDs, and participating user IDs.
Track active rooms and user participation.
Optional Features:
Implement "like" or "emoji" reactions for messages.
Allow users to report inappropriate messages.

**6. Security and Privacy**<br>
Anonymous Authentication: No personal details, generate random usernames.
Message Encryption: Use end-to-end encryption for sensitive messages (optional).
Moderation and Reporting: Make sure to log abusive behavior without tracking user identities.
Token-Based Access: Use tokens for session management, ensuring the app doesnâ€™t leak user info.

**7. Frontend Implementation**<br>
Create basic components:
Login/Join Screen: Allow users to pick random usernames and select chat rooms.
Chat Interface: Display messages, users, and active rooms.
Room List: A page where users can select/join rooms.
Message Input: For users to send messages in real-time.

**8. Testing and Deployment**<br>
Test the app thoroughly:
Ensure messages are sent/received properly.
Test for edge cases (e.g., empty rooms, message overload).
Test the app across different browsers and devices.
Deploy:
Use Heroku/Vercel for hosting the backend and frontend.
Use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database.

**9. Launch and Feedback**<br>
Release the app to a small group of students for initial testing and feedback.
Gather feedback, especially about usability, performance, and privacy concerns.
Iterate on the app based on user input.
Optional Features for Future Development
Group Notifications: Notify users when new messages arrive in a room.
Anonymous Reactions: Allow users to react to messages anonymously.
Typing Indicators: Show when someone is typing.
User Blocking: Allow users to block certain users anonymously.
